# Café Management System (C++)

This project is a Café Management System developed in C++ using core Object-Oriented Programming concepts. It implements inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and aggregation while providing essential café operations such as menu handling, order processing, billing, inventory tracking, and customer feedback management.

## 🚀 Features
- Menu item management  
- Order placement and modification  
- Automatic billing generation  
- Inventory monitoring and stock deduction  
- Customer feedback collection  
- Admin and staff roles  
- File handling for permanent data storage  
- UML diagrams included in documentation  

## 🧩 OOP Concepts Used
- **Inheritance** – Admin and Staff inherit from User  
- **Polymorphism** – Overridden functions across derived classes  
- **Composition** – Order owns Billing, MenuItem owns Ingredients  
- **Aggregation** – InventoryManager maintains Ingredient list  
- **Encapsulation** – Class attributes kept private with getter/setter methods  

## 📁 Project Structure
/src -> C++ source files
/docs -> Project report, UML diagrams
/data -> Text files for saved menu, orders, billing, feedback
README.md -> Project overview

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C++  
- File Handling  
- UML Class Diagrams  

## 📄 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Compile the `.cpp` files using any C++ compiler  
3. Run the executable to start the café system
